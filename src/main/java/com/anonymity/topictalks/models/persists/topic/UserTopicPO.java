/**
 * The {@code UserTopicPO} class represents a user-topic mapping entity in the application.
 * It extends the {@code DateAudit} class, inheriting fields for auditing creation and modification dates.
 *
 * This entity is used to associate users with specific topic children.
 *
 * - {@code userId}: The identifier of the user associated with the topic.
 *
 * - {@code topicChildrenId}: The identifier of the topic children associated with the user.
 *
 * - {@code userInfo}: Represents the user information associated with this user-topic mapping.
 *   It is annotated with {@code @ManyToOne} to establish a many-to-one relationship with the {@code UserPO} class.
 *
 * - {@code topicChildrenInfo}: Represents the topic children information associated with this user-topic mapping.
 *   It is annotated with {@code @ManyToOne} to establish a many-to-one relationship with the {@code TopicChildrenPO} class.
