/**
 * The {@code FriendListPO} class represents a friend list entity in the application. It extends the {@code DateAudit}
 * class, inheriting fields for auditing creation and modification dates.
 *
 * The class is annotated with {@code @Entity} to indicate that it is a JPA entity that can be persisted in a database.
 * It defines the mapping between the class and the database table using {@code @Table}.
 *
 * - {@code id}: The unique identifier for the friend list entry. It is annotated with {@code @Id} and configured to
 *   be generated automatically using a sequence.
 *
 * - {@code userId}: Represents the user who owns the friend list entry. It is annotated with {@code @ManyToOne} to
 *   establish a many-to-one relationship with the {@code UserPO} class.
 *
 * - {@code friendId}: Represents the user who is a friend in the friend list entry. It is also annotated with
 *   {@code @ManyToOne} to establish a many-to-one relationship with the {@code UserPO} class.
 *
 * - {@code isPublic}: Indicates whether the friend list is public or not.
 *
 * - {@code isAccept}: Indicates whether the friend request has been accepted or not.
