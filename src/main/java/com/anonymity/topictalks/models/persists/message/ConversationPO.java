/**
 * The {@code ConversationPO} class represents a conversation entity in the application.

 * - {@code id}: The unique identifier for the conversation. It is automatically generated and serves as the primary key.
 *
 * - {@code chatName}: The name of the chat conversation, which can be nullable.
 *
 * - {@code isGroupChat}: Indicates whether the conversation is a group chat or not.
 *
 * - {@code topicChildren}: Represents the topic within which this conversation is associated.
 *   It is annotated with {@code @ManyToOne} to establish a many-to-one relationship with the {@code TopicChildrenPO} class.
