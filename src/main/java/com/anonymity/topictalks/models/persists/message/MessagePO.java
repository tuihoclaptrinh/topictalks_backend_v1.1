/**
 * The {@code MessagePO} class represents a message entity in the application.
 * It extends the {@code DateAudit} class, inheriting fields for auditing creation and modification dates.
 *
 * - {@code id}: The unique identifier for the message. It is automatically generated and serves as the primary key.
 *
 * - {@code content}: The content of the message.
 *
 * - {@code senderId}: Represents the user who sent the message.
 *   It is annotated with {@code @ManyToOne} to establish a many-to-one relationship with the {@code UserPO} class.
 *
 * - {@code conversationId}: Represents the conversation to which this message belongs.
 *   It is annotated with {@code @ManyToOne} to establish a many-to-one relationship with the {@code ConversationPO} class.
